# Cell-Cell Communication Analysis in Alzheimer's Disease

This R script performs an analysis of cell-cell communication in Alzheimer's disease using the `CellChat` package and Seurat for single-cell RNA-seq data processing.

## Data Preparation

- Load and preprocess the familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) dataset.
- Perform quality control (QC) analysis, including visualization of QC metrics and filtering of low-quality cells.
- Normalize the data and identify variable genes for downstream analysis.
- Perform principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering to identify cell populations.
- Visualize cell populations using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP).
- Identify marker genes for each cell cluster.
- Annotate cell types based on marker gene expression.

## Cell-Cell Communication Analysis

- Load the preprocessed data into `CellChat`.
- Perform communication analysis using the `CellChat` package, including identification of overexpressed genes and interactions.
- Project data onto known protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks.
- Visualize communication networks using circle plots, hierarchy plots, and heatmaps.
- Analyze signaling gene expression distribution.
- Compute centrality measures and analyze signaling roles in the network.

## Usage

1. Install required R packages and dependencies.
2. Load and preprocess single-cell RNA-seq data using Seurat.
3. Execute the provided R code for cell-cell communication analysis.
4. Adjust parameters and pathways as needed for specific analyses.
5. Visualize and interpret results to gain insights into cell communication dynamics in Alzheimer's disease.

## Dependencies

- `CellChat`
